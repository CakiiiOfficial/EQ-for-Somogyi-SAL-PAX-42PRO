# EQ-for-Somogyi-SAL-PAX-42PRO
I've found that these speakers sound sort of harsh at high volumes so I've decided to make EQ to tame it and make it comfortable for long listening sessions.

I have used Equalizer APO on Windows machine to make these speakers sound balanced. File 'Somogyi PAX 42PRO.txt' contains EQ info which you can import and try to see if they sound good. You can use this on other equalizers which can improve sound experience if you use a Mac or a Linux or any type of machine assuming they have EQ feature.

If you happen to want to get these speakers, you can do so on this site:

If you happen to be able to improve the EQ, you may go ahead and fork it which can help me improve PA speakers for Audiophiles.
